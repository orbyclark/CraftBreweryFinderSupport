## Overview

Craft Brewery Finder ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## Information We Collect

With your permission, the App accesses your device's location to show breweries near you. This data is used only within the App to provide search results and is not stored on our servers or shared with third parties.

**Favorites and Preferences**
When you save breweries to your favorites, this information is stored locally on your device. We do not collect or sync this data to external servers.

We may collect anonymous usage data (such as which features are used most frequently) to help us improve the App. This data cannot be used to identify you personally.

## Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it when contacting support.

## Third-Party Services

The App may use third-party services for maps and brewery data. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.

## Children's Privacy
